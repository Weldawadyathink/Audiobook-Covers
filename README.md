# Audiobook-Covers

Audiobook-Covers is a project that downloads and archives audiobook covers from [reddit.com/r/audiobookcovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiobookcovers/), stores them in a local database, and performs OCR using Google Cloud Vision API. The project also includes deployment scripts for Cloudflare R2, S3 compatible services, and Elasticsearch. The Cloudflare Worker serves as a serverless API for search, and Cloudflare Pages hosts a website for search functionality and API documentation.

The purpose of this project is to create a centralized and searchable archive of audiobook covers for enthusiasts, researchers, and developers.

The official host for this project is at [audiobookcovers.com](https://audiobookcovers.com)
